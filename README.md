MactsAsBeacon
=============

A tiny app to turn a Bluetooth LE-equipped Mac into an iBeacon.

Based on code from @mttrb - http://www.blendedcocoa.com/blog/2013/11/02/mavericks-as-an-ibeacon/

To run the app without Xcode, download the MactsAsBeacon.app in the root folder of this project.



This code can work, but I modify some configure.
